# Example react monorepo using Bazel

**This is experimental, as part of mds! There may be breaking changes.**

This is part of the ABC project. The overall goal is to make it possible to
develop react/next/apollo applications the same way at Google.

## Guide to the example

This example is a monorepo, meant to show many different features and integrations that we expect are generally useful for enterprise use cases.

## Installation

You only need to install one build tool, and which one you choose typically depends on what kind of development you do most often.

## Development

First we'll run the development server:

```bash
$ bazel run docs
```
